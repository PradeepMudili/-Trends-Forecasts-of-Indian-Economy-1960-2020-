# Trends and Forecasts of Indian Economy Through Statistical Insights and Machine Learning Techniques (1960‚Äì2020)

## üìö Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Indian economy from 1960 to 2020 using both statistical and machine learning approaches. It applies Exploratory Data Analysis, Ridge Regression, K-Means Clustering, and ARIMA Time Series Forecasting to real macroeconomic indicators, drawing actionable insights that can aid in policy, research, and business applications. The work was completed as part of a B.Sc. in Statistics, under the mentorship of Mr. N. Rakesh and in collaboration with Codegnan IT Solutions, Vijayawada.

- `GDP growth (annual %)`: Annual GDP growth rate  
- `Imports`/`Exports (% of GDP)`: Trade as a share of GDP  
- `Total reserves`: Includes gold, in US dollars  
- `Inflation (annual %)`: Consumer price inflation  
- `Population, total`: Total population  
- `Population growth (%)`: Annual population growth

## üìà Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summarized key variable trends, checked for missing values, and visualized data with boxplots, bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps.

### Ridge Regression
- Built a regularized linear model to predict GDP using all economic variables; addressed multicollinearity and identified most significant predictors.
- Model fit: \( R^2 = 0.9674 \)

### K-Means Clustering
- Used Elbow Method to choose 3 optimal clusters.
- Segmented economic periods into Stable, Volatile (high inflation), and Downturn regimes based on GDP growth and inflation.

### ARIMA Time Series Forecasting
- Performed Dickey-Fuller tests and ACF/PACF analysis.
- Modeled GDP with ARIMA(1,1,1) (after log/difference transformation) and inflation with ARIMA(1,0,1).
- Produced 5-year forecasts with strong accuracy (\( \text{MAPE} \approx 2.36\% \)).

## üèÜ Key Results & Insights

- **Consistent GDP Growth:** GDP grew from \$37B to \$2.83T (1960‚Äì2020).
- **Impactful Variables:** GDP per capita, population, life expectancy, and population growth are most influential for GDP prediction.
- **Economy Clusters:** Identifiable phases‚Äîstable growth, high-inflation volatility, and slowdowns.
- **Reliable Forecasts:** Models indicate continued GDP growth and stable inflation barring major external shocks.
